                <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-4">
                    Taking the plunge to go independently, I completed various STA qualifications which allowed me to start the foundation of my company. From only starting off with a few clients, I gradually grew my business initially through ‘word of mouth’ alone, to eventually increasing in popularity and the demand for both simply Swimming allowed me to expand through out Thurrock.
